# Treon
This is our repository for thesis.

Please take note of the following:

The files will be zipped, and each folder corresponds version number.

We will use semantic versioning:

--- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH ---

MAJOR – Big changes; backward-incompatible (e.g., new architecture).

MINOR – New features; backward-compatible.

PATCH – Bug fixes or small tweaks; backward-compatible.


We will start with: Treon 1.0.0


Inform me the changes first before uploading into the repository so we could double check the version number.


SALAMAT !! :)
